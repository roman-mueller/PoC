PoC exploit for Blurams Lumi Security Camera (A31C) version up to 23.0406.435.4120 (CVE-2023-50488).

For details see: https://infosec.rm-it.de/2024/02/01/blurams-lumi-security-camera-analysis/ 

Run `gen_auth_file.sh` to generate the file `auth.ini`, adjust `VERSION` variable if needed.  
Copy the `auth.ini` file to an SD-card into a folder named `/factorytest/`.  
Create a shell script with any payload you want to execute, place it also in `/factorytest/` folder, name it `factorytest.sh`.  
Insert the SD-card into the camera device and reboot it. The `/factorytest/factorytest.sh` script will be executed with root privileges on the device.  

See example files in `/factorytest/` in this repository.  
The payload will create a new UID 0 account with the name `toor` without a password, and the `telnetd` service will be started.  
The new `toor` account can then be used to connect via telnet to the device.  
Note that executing the factorytest script will not fully start all services on the device (e.g. the main camera binary will not be started).
