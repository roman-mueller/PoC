PoC exploit for Blurams Lumi Security Camera (A31C) version 2.3.38.12558 (CVE-2023-51820).

For details see: https://infosec.rm-it.de/2024/02/01/blurams-lumi-security-camera-analysis/ 

Copy the files in `/factorytest/` of this repository into a folder named `/factorytest/` on an SD-card.
Insert the SD-card into the device and reboot it. The `/factorytest/exploit.sh` script will be executed with root privileges on the device.
The payload will create a new UID 0 account with the name `toor` without a password, and the `telnetd` service will be started.
The new `toor` account can then be used to connect via telnet to the device.
Adjust the payload as needed, the generated HMAC only covers the `auth.ini` file, changes to `exploit.sh` can be made without requiring to calculate a new HMAC.
Note that executing the factorytest script will not fully start all services on the device (e.g. the main camera binary will not be started).
